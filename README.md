# Task2

This code defines a function named calculate_min_coins that takes three parameters: change, denominations, and coins_available. The function calculates the minimum number of coins required to make up the specified amount of change using the available denominations and coins. The function returns a list of the coins required to make up the change or an empty list if change cannot be made.

The denominations parameter is a list of integers representing the available coin denominations, sorted in decreasing order. The coins_available parameter is a dictionary that maps each denomination to the number of coins available for that denomination.

The function first sorts the denominations in decreasing order using the sorted() function with the reverse=True argument. Then, it initializes an empty list to store the coins required to make up the change. It then loops through the denominations and checks if there are coins available for each denomination. If there are, it repeatedly subtracts the denomination from the change amount and adds the denomination to the coins list until there are no more coins available for that denomination or the change amount is less than the denomination.
